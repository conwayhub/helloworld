There once was a lonely soul 
A lonely soul who found a hole
A hole inhabited by a troll
A troll who's company was droll
"TUT TUT", said the lonely soul
"What is friendship to a troll?
I still have standards, don't I?"
"Standards, sure" Said the troll,
"But the world is going to change
around you, and you'll be left behind
you anti-troll bigot."

And the lonely soul felt very attacked.
